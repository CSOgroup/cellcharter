class GaussianMixture(PyCaveGaussianMixture):
    """
    Adapted version of GaussianMixture clustering model from the `PyCave <https://pycave.borchero.com/index.html>`_ library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters
        The number of components in the GMM. The dimensionality of each component is automatically inferred from the data.
    covariance_type
        The type of covariance to assume for all Gaussian components.
    init_strategy
        The strategy for initializing component means and covariances.
    init_means
        An optional initial guess for the means of the components. If provided,
        must be a tensor of shape ``[num_components, num_features]``. If this is given,
        the ``init_strategy`` is ignored and the means are handled as if K-means
        initialization has been run.
    convergence_tolerance
        The change in the per-datapoint negative log-likelihood which
        implies that training has converged.
    covariance_regularization
        A small value which is added to the diagonal of the
        covariance matrix to ensure that it is positive semi-definite.
    batch_size: The batch size to use when fitting the model. If not provided, the full
        data will be used as a single batch. Set this if the full data does not fit into
        memory.
    trainer_params
        Initialization parameters to use when initializing a PyTorch Lightning
        trainer. By default, it disables various stdout logs unless PyCave is configured to
        do verbose logging. Checkpointing and logging are disabled regardless of the log
        level. This estimator further sets the following overridable defaults:
        - ``max_epochs=100``.
    random_state
        Initialization seed.
